- Rich text formatting
- Emoji reactions

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain consistent error handling
3. Use async/await for asynchronous operations
4. Document all public interfaces
5. Write unit tests for core functionality
6. Handle rate limiting appropriately

## Next Steps
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement basic client with authentication
3. Add WebSocket event handling
4. Build message processing system
5. Integrate file handling
6. Add advanced features
7. Write tests and documentation
